# A chunk evaluation is added to find the right chunk size and overlap for the RAG pipeline.
# In this example, we evaluate multiple chunk sizes and overlaps to find the right balance,
# with the following combinations:
# | chunk_size | chunk_overlap |
# |------------|---------------|
# | 128        | 0            |
# | 128        | 64           |
# | 256        | 0            |
# | 256        | 128          |
# | 512        | 0            |
# | 512        | 256          |
